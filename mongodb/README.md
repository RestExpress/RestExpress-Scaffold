A MongoDB-Backed RestExpress Server
===================================
A template RestExpress project with MongoDB persistence for domain objects.

To run the project:

	Make sure MongoDB is running
	mvn clean package exec:java

To create a 'fat' runnable jar file:

	mvn clean package

To run the jar file created via package

	java -jar target/{project-name}.jar [environment]


Configuration
-------------

By default, the 'mvn package' goal will create a fat jar file including the configuration files in src/main/resources.
These are loaded from the classpath at runtime. However, to override the values embedded in the jar file, simply create
a new configuration file on the classpath for the desired environment. For example, './config/dev/environment.properties'
and any settings in that file will get added to, or override settings embedded in the jar file.
